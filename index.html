        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <p> Hi my name is Dominic, I am a  student working with <b>TSN</b> academy.
          I am creating my own website for The Digtal Design Program. I used 3D paint to created a 
          wireframe for my website and coded one page for my website with Visual Studio code.
           My Exprience with coding was challenging because of labels and commands but I had fun with the freedom
          of creating my projects. Some of my Favorite things to do Are listed In my Hobbies Heading Other 
          Stuff I love is hanging out with my family on trips Last year I went to Universal for my birthday 
          and took a picture with my favorite superhero spider-man. Memories with my family are very important to
           because it shows how much We care and love about each other. 
         </p>

              <h1>About DDI</h1>
           <p>The DDI Program is for Students that like coding and 3D modeling. I joined this program this summer to learned about 3D design and code. My goals have been completed with creating my 3D designs and other projects including finishing my website. I have been with TSN for two years and Joining  Digital Design was really helpful since i had an intrest in game design, My instructors in Digital Design helped me with all of my projects my most favorites  about this Program is me making my Fornite game in Unreal Editor For Fortnite and working in Fusion 360.
